This layer could be an issue in areas where wind has blown the snow into drifts. 80-130 cm below the surface is an old persistent weak layer that formed in early December. This layer mostly consists of facets (sugary snow) with some isolated areas also containing small surface hoar (feathery crystals).

Near the bottom of the snowpack lies a mix of crusts and facets that formed in late October/early November.
